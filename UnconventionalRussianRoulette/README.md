# Unconventional Russian Roulette

Russian Roulette is a well-known game, it usually plays with a 6-chamber revolver. When the game begins, the cylinder is spun, and each player takes their turn to pull the trigger. The survive wins.

However, **Unconventional Russian Roulette** introduced different sets of rules in which three bullets are loaded **adjacently**. Let's imagine this scenario:

Three bullets are loaded into the cylinder, **Player A** has taken a shot and survived. We, as **Player B**, need to decide whether to take a shot or not. For the sake of simplicity, the game ends this round and here are the conditions:

* If we took a shot, and it was empty -> **WE WON 1 MILLION DOLLARS**
* If we chose to stay, and it was loaded -> **WE WON 1 MILLION DOLLARS**

If the main goal here is to take **1 MILLION DOLLARS** back home at all costs.
Should **Player B** take a shot or not? and Why?
